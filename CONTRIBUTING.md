# Contributor Guide

## Getting Started

Glad that you decided to make your contribution in Dash, to set up your development environment, run the following commands:

```bash
# in your working directory
$ git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash
$ cd dash
# create a virtualenv
$ python3 -m venv venv
# activate the virtualenv (on windows venv\scripts\activate)
$ . venv/bin/activate
# Install the dev dependencies
$ pip install -r .circleci/requirements/dev-requirements.txt
```
## Git

Use the [GitHub flow][] when proposing contributions to this repository (i.e. create a feature branch and submit a PR against the default branch).

### Organize your commits

For pull request with notable file changes or a big feature developmennt, we highly recommend to organize the commits in a logical manner, so it

- makes a code review experience much more pleasant
- facilitates a possible cherry picking with granular commits

*an intutive [example](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/548) is worth a thousand words.*

#### Git Desktop

Git command veterans might argue that a simple terminal and a cherry switch keyboard is the most elegant solution. But in general, a desktop tool makes the task easier.

### Coding Style

We use both `flake8` and `pylint` for basic linting check, please refer to the relevant steps in `.circleci/config.yml`.

Note that we also start using [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as formatter during the test code migration.

## Tests

We started migrating to [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) from `unittest` as our test automation framework. You will see more testing enhancements in the near future.

### Unit Tests

For simple API changes, please add adequate unit tests under `/tests/unit`

Note: *You might find out that we have more integration tests than unit tests in Dash. This doesn't mean unit tests are not important, the [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) is still valid. Dash project has its unique traits which needs more integration coverage than typical software project, another reason was that dash was a quick prototype crafted by chris in a lovely montreal summer.*

### Integration Tests

We introduced the `dash.testing` feature in [Dash 1.0](https://community.plot.ly/t/announcing-dash-testing/24868). It makes writing a Dash integration test much easier. Please read the [tutorial](http://dash.plot.ly/testing) and add relevant integration tests with any new features or bug fixes.
